# .MD?

While browsing through **GitHub** or **GitLab** you may have noticed styled README files with a strange .md file extension. The MD stands for markdown. If that is strange or new to you your in the right spot! keep reading and you will learn more about what markdown is and how to use it!

## What is markdown?

> Markdown is simular to html in that it is a standard for structions things. Markdown and html both fall under the umbrella of the category of languages called **markup languages.** A markup langues is just a way to stuctor a document or file and tell a system how to display it. In the case of html it tells the brower how to display the content. Markdown it no differnt it allows you or me to write thing "_tags_" and tell a markdown transcomiler how to display the text.

## Why bother with markdown?

As mentioned markdown is used when writing documents with GitHub, or GitLab but some of the syntaxes are also supported in, google docs, slack, and many many others.  You can even use[ Pandoc and markdown ](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown "Pandoc and markdown together")together ([https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown "https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown")) to make beautiful documents and even presentations if you use a tool like beamer.  As you can see there are lots of ways to use markdown. I am even writing this blog in markdown. 

## Ok, let's learn some stuff.

> Although there are different flavors/standards of markdown they all of the same basic structure.  

Headings are simple just a "#" followed by the text you want your heading to me. More #s the smaller the heading

Example

    # heading one

    ## heading two

    ### heading three

    ...

    ###### heading 6

This will look like

# heading one

## heading two

### heading 3

...

###### Heading 6

Lists are also easy just use a "-" of unordered lists and numbers for an ordered list.

    - This

    - is

    - a

    - list

would look like

* this
* is
* a
* list
